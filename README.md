#Elixir Dockerfile

This Dockerfile enables you to create your own [Elixir](http://www.elixir-lang.org) and [Erlang OTP](http://www.erlang.org/) docker image using the latest version of both.

This Dockerfile is based on the [phusion/baseimage](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/phusion/baseimage/) docker image which is designed to overcome some issues using base Ubuntu in a Docker container.

Have fun and feel free to submit any changes!
